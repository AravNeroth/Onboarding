# Onboarding

Steps:
- [X] Fork this repository into your account
- [X] Remove all `Analog Input` columns with dead sensors. These are sensors whose values stay constant.
- [X] Graph the RPM, and TPS columns seperately (or in the same graph for fun lol)
- [X] Submit a PR back to this repository with your code
- [X] Send me (@sq.id on discord) a message with a link to your PR and why you want to join the club.


We have an open door policy, but require new members to follow basic coding structures to get into team projects.
